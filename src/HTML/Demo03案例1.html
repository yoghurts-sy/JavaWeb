    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some passers-sy were asked for a question that is satisfied with your life? The answer varies from person to person. I'd like to share my understanding with you.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initially, when you are content with your life we can conclude that you feel happy. If you hold the belief that wealthy men who have quantities of assets are happy. In the contrast, they must pay much more attention to their properties and be afraid of theirs loss than ordinary people that leads to physical and mental exhaustion. What really courts is that they are trapped in endless business and definitely have no time to chase the dream what they deeply love. That's why I keep my views that a person feels happy should be full of spirit and energy whether he is wealthy or not with the purpose of achieving something with his genuine passions. As far as I am concerned, it's absolutely wrong to equal happiness with wealth. Only if you build up a strong will to achieve something meaningful and do some charity to give back to the society, you will be the one who is really happy. Last but not least, when you strive for pursuing materiall life, just stop it for a while to feel the heart of life.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the materialistic age, people have a keen pursuit to wealth what likes a trap that making them can't look forward to the things they truly love. I appeal that giving your heart a holiday to feel happy.
